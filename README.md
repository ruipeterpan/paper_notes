# Rui's Paper Reading Notes - Introduction

## Introduction

This GitBook mainly hosts [Rui Pan](https://ruipan.xyz)'s paper reading notes. I also keep a non-hardcore blog [here](blog/blog-index/).

The majority of the papers here are in the field of [Machine Learning Systems](machine-learning-systems/index/) and [Operating Systems](operating-systems/index/). There are some miscellaneous papers, though, that are under the index [Misc Topics](misc-topics/index.md).

If you spot a mistake or have any suggestions, you are more than welcome to drop me an email at rpan33@wisc.edu!
