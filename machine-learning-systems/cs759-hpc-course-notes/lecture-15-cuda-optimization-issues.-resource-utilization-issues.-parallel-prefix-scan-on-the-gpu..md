# Lecture 15: CUDA Optimization Issues. Resource Utilization Issues. Parallel Prefix Scan on the GPU.

## Lecture Summary

* Last time
  * Case studies: parallel reduction on the GPU & 1D convolution
  * Looking beyond today: some more GPU computing feature, but looking for a while into optimization features
* Today
  * One more cast study: parallel prefix scan
  * Using streams in GPU computing: increasing problem size; improving execution speeds
