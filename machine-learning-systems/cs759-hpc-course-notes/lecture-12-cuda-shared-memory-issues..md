# Lecture 12: CUDA Shared Memory Issues.

## Lecture Summary

* Last time
  * Aspects related to how GPU memory operations take place
    * Registers, local memory, shared memory, global memory \(texture & constant memories\)
* Today
  * GPU mem operations: focus on shared memory
  * GPU mem operations: focus on global memory
  * How parallel computing makes memory operations tricky
  * Atomic operations
  * Things that determine the speed of execution of a kernel
