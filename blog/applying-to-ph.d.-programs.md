# Applying to Ph.D. programs

After reading through tens, if not hundreds of blog posts on applying to Ph.D. programs, it would be inappropriate if I didn't write down something and throw in my two cents about this exhausting but ultimately self-enriching and fascinating process.

This series of blog posts will hopefully be a useful guide to the students who are pondering the million-dollar question of whether to do a Ph.D. I will hopefully give you a glimpse of what the application process looks like, and offer some advice on how to best approach, embrace, and enjoy this unique journey.
