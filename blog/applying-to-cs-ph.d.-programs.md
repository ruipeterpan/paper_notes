# Applying to CS Ph.D. programs

After going through tens, if not hundreds of blog posts on applying to Ph.D. programs, it would almost be inappropriate if I don't write down something and throw in my two cents about this exhausting but ultimately self-enriching and fascinating process.

This series of blog posts will hopefully be a useful guide to the students who are planning to apply to Ph.D. programs. (I was trying to target those who are pondering the million-dollar question of whether to do a Ph.D., but I don't feel entitled to write about that yet...) I will try to give you a glimpse of what the application process looks like and offer some advice on how to best approach, embrace, and enjoy this unique journey. Hope this helps you! If so, please consider paying it forward (maybe start by giving a hand to junior undergraduates in your research group).

Note that whatever I write down is biased as a result of my personal background and experience. For context, I grew up and went to high school in China, and then did my bachelor's in the United States, majoring in computer science and mathematics. During my undergraduate, I worked on systems (cluster resource management) for ML starting from the summer of my second year, and I fully committed to doing a Ph.D. in my third year. My research interests fall under the big topic of "Systems and Networking", and for my Ph.D. application, I applied to professors whose topics of interest range broadly across all system aspects of big data, e.g. mlsys, serverless, cloud computing, video analytics, networks, etc.

## Chapter 2: Narrowing down the POIs/programs

A lot of people agree with me that when applying to Ph.D. programs, the advisor is the most important factor, even more so than the school/department itself. Thus, picking awesome professors/person of interest (POIs) is arguably the most important part of the application process: pick good (in terms of research interest match and personality match) and you might be happy for life.

95% of the students I know apply for 5-20 programs, and they typically target 1-3 POIs for each program. For me, I checked out \~50 professors in my field of interest and ended up boiling the list down to \~30 professors that I really like from \~15 schools. This chapter will try to answer two questions: (1) how do you put up the big list of professors that you are generally interested in working with, and (2) how to narrow the list down to those who you are really interested in working with?

### How do you put up the big list of POIs?

* Check out your advisor's lab mates, recent collaborators, and direct connections in their network. These people are likely to share similar interests with your current advisor, plus they know your advisor personally, so these folks should be fun to work with assuming you love what you are doing right now.
* The math folks have a great thing called [The Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org) where you can see this tree of academic relationships. You can also trace the tree of professors in cs, starting from very senior professors who work in your field of interest, and then go down the genealogy tree to look for those who are holding tenure-track positions. For me, I started with Ion Stoica. Fun fact: as many as six of my professors of interest have had direct connections with Ion!
* [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org) is also a great place to visit. You would want to first list the target conferences that you mostly read papers from (for me it was SOSP, OSDI, EuroSys, ATC, SoCC, NSDI, SIGCOMM). Then, go to CSRankings, select your target conferences, check out the professors from each school that has published in these venues, and go through them one by one. I personally spent a day at each school going over everyone. Unless you already have a specific topic that you would like to work on, IMO you should be open-minded in this part of your search and try to check out as many professors as possible. When I was going over csrankings.org, I had also marked professors who publish in venues like SIGMOD & VLDB, SIGMETRICS, HPC conferences, and ML conferences like ICML. Although I still ended up applying to system professors, it was fun to get to know what other folks in your field are working on.
* Take the same list of venues that you like. Then, take a look at the program committee of the recent conferences, and go to their personal sites one by one. Doing so will produce a list that overlaps very much with the one you got from csrankings.org
* Talk with other people, e.g. your lab mates, your current advisor, or Ph.D. students who were in your lab during their undergraduate. You will really get a lot from this! My personal story is that I didn't consider applying to the program I ended up committing to (?) until after a friend of mine strongly recommended that I shoot this POI an email. I ended up getting in touch with the POI and found that I liked him a lot. So yes, talk to people!

### How do you narrow the list down?

* On one end, you should work with people whose research interests truly excite you. Although I had a few professors who work on databases/HPC on my first list, I ended up throwing them away because I really prefer some topics over others.
* On the other end, you should not work with people who are bad advisors. Advisors who ghosts/abuses students are a big no-no! I personally used two approaches to filter out these professors:
  * Check out their RateMyProfessors reviews. I get that teaching isn't for everyone and some professors put more emphasis on doing research, which is fine by me -- but ultimately, I don't really want to be working with someone who is a 1.2, because I think if a professor fails to create a supportive learning environment for their students, then it's unlikely for them to do so for their advisees. IMO a score that starts with a 1 is somewhat of a red flag.
  * Talk with their current students or search for their posts online. More practically, talk with people who might have heard about some bad news -- they tend to travel very fast. If a lot of Ph.D. students quit a lab halfway through, then there has to be something bad going on.

## Chapter 3: Cold-emailing professors of interest (WIP)

Now that you have narrowed down a list of 10\~30 professors who you want to work with, it is time to get in touch with them.

triple check your email before sending them out! e.g. check for attachments, spelling mistakes, etc.

make a personal webpage!!! this is really important.





## Chapter 4: Asking for recommendation letters and sending out applications

Most CS Ph.D. programs ask for three letters of recommendation.

First of all, IMO it is very important to understand what the other side looks like about this recommendation system. Except for the actual letter itself, your recommenders will also be asked a few questions, including clarity of goals for graduate study, English skills, creativity, etc. The "scores" recommenders can give are one of truly exceptional (top 1%), outstanding (top 10%), above average (top 25%), not applicable/unable to respond, etc. Some other questions include ([source](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread\&tid=581428)):

* How long have you known the applicant?
* What group are you using for comparison?
* Admission recommendation to program is {strongly recommended, recommended, recommended with reservation, etc.}

Moving on. Before sending out requests for letters, you have to figure out who your letter writers will be. It would be best if your letter writers are:

* Well-known in the research community. Having a senior professor/big name write a strong recommendation letter for you helps immensely. Either that or some junior professors who are actively publishing in a relevant field. These professors have a big network of connections, which is valuable considering how important good connections are. In contrast, a letter from say a postdoc is probably less helpful -- but if a postdoc is writing a letter for you, try to have them co-write a letter with their advisor.
* Someone who knows you well. If someone has worked with you extensively, they will have plenty of chance to know you and see that bright side of yours. If you mainly worked with Ph.D. students/postdocs during your research but a professor who wasn't very hands-on toward your research is writing the letter, I would suggest coordinating with those people so that the professor can put more of your bright sides into the letter.
* Preferably someone from the academia instead of the industry, and if they are from the industry, they should be involved in doing research (e.g. leading a research team. At least they should have a Ph.D. degree?). I'm not too sure about this, but rumors say that letters from people in the industry are pretty much useless. This makes some sense because the qualifications of a good Ph.D. student is somewhat different from those of a good intern, and letter writers from the industry would have no idea of what the program committee is hoping to see. Note that when I say people from the industry, I'm referring more to an average SWE intern's mentor -- if Lidong Zhou or Amar Phanishayee writes you a letter then obviously it's very good!

Now that you know who you will be asking, it would be best to let them know about it. Here are some tips for doing that.

* Ask early. You don't need to know your exact school list when you send your first email request, but you should at least give people a rough idea of the number of letters and when they will be due. Professors are busy, like really busy. Please ask for letters as early as possible so they can plan accordingly. Two months in advance is better than one, and one month is better than two weeks. Imagine being a professor who's going through the finals week and a couple of conference deadlines, and boom, five students show up to ask for a total of 100 letters that are due in one week. Just thinking about that makes me uncomfortable. Besides that, if you apply to say 30 (?!) programs, some professors may not be too happy about submitting all those letters and will only agree to submit 10 of them. In that case, you should of course ask for some other professors to fill in the gap, but anyway, you don't want to know about this a week before the application deadline.
* Communicate clearly. It would suck if professors finish your letter but don't know where to submit them. My advice is: (1) It is preferable to send official requests through application portals in batches so those emails don't get lost in the professor's email inbox. (2) Create a table in Google Sheet to keep track of the programs you are applying to, the application deadlines, and the status of the requests. For example, knowing the date of when you sent a request will be helpful when a professor looks up that email in their inbox. Of course, share this google sheet with your letter writers. (3) Send email reminders to remind professors about an upcoming application deadline, preferably a week in advance if not more. Note that for most of the programs, the deadline for people to submit letters is some time after the application deadline, so don't panic if a professor only uploads the letters after the deadline.
* Provide enough information. Once a professor agrees to write you a letter, attach a lot of files when you get back them, e.g. your cv, draft SoP, transcript, final project report. Some professors will also ask you to provide a list of relevant personal information, e.g. classes you have taken, major accomplishments, etc. Besides those, remind professors about how your opportunity with them helped you grow as a scholar.
* Ask for strong letters. It goes without saying that strong letters from professors say a lot about who you are as an applicant -- they will make a difference in your application. When you ask for letters, explicitly ask for strong letters, so that professors who will otherwise write average letters can have the chance to let you about that.

And at last, you should write them a thank you letter. Send them a small gift (something under $20 should be ok, e.g. a box of chocolate provided that they are not allergic to chocolate :P). When you commit to a program a few months later, also remember to send another email to let your writers know about the good news -- they will really like it!
