# Applying to CS Ph.D. programs

After going through tens, if not hundreds of blog posts on applying to Ph.D. programs, it would almost be inappropriate if I don't write down something and throw in my two cents about this exhausting but ultimately self-enriching and fascinating process.

This series of blog posts will hopefully be a useful guide to the students who are planning to apply to Ph.D. programs. (I was trying to target those who are pondering the million-dollar question of whether to do a Ph.D., but I don't feel entitled to write about that yet...) I will try to give you a glimpse of what the application process looks like and offer some advice on how to best approach, embrace, and enjoy this unique journey. Hope this helps you, and if so, please consider paying it forward, maybe starting by giving a hand to junior undergraduates in your research group.

Note that whatever I write down is biased as a result of my personal background and experience. For context, I grew up and went to high school in China, and then I did my bachelor's in the United States, majoring in computer science and mathematics. During my undergraduate, I worked on systems (cluster resource management) for ML starting from the summer of my second year, and I fully committed to doing a Ph.D. in my third year. For my Ph.D. application, I applied to professors whose topics of interest range broadly across all system aspects of big data, e.g. mlsys, serverless, cloud computing, video analytics, networks, etc.

Now that you have narrowed down a list of 10\~30 professors who you want to work with, it is time to get in touch with them.

Chapter 4: Asking for recommendation letters and sending out applications

Most CS Ph.D. programs ask for three letters of recommendation. TODO: describe what it's like to fill in an application

Before sending out requests for letters, you have to figure out who your letter writers will be. It would be best if your letter writers are:

* Well-known in the research community. Having a senior professor/big name write a strong recommendation letter for you helps immensely. Either that or some junior professors who are actively publishing in a relevant field. These professors have a big network of connections, which is valuable considering how important good connections are. In contrast, letters from say a postdoc are probably less helpful -- but if a postdoc is writing a letter for you, try to have them co-write a letter with their advisor.
* Someone who knows you well.
* Preferably someone from the academia instead of the industry, and if they are from the industry, they should be involved in doing research (e.g. leading a research team. At least they should have a Ph.D. degree?). I'm not too sure about this, but rumors say that letters from people in the industry are pretty much useless. This makes some sense because the qualifications of a good Ph.D. student is somewhat different from those of a good intern, and letter writers from the industry would have no idea of what the program committee is hoping to see. Note that when I say people from the industry, I'm more referring to an average SWE intern's mentor -- if Lidong Zhou or Amar Phanishayee writes you a letter then obviously it's very good!

Now that you know who you will be asking, it would be best to let them know. Here are some tips for doing that.

* Ask early. Professors are busy, like really busy. You should ask for letters as early as possible so they can plan accordingly. Two months in advance is better than one, and one month is better than two weeks. Imagine being a professor who's going through the finals week and a couple of conference deadlines, and boom, five students show up to ask for a total of 100 letters that are due in one week. Just thinking about that gives me chills. Besides that, if you apply to say 30 (?!) programs, some professors may not be too happy about submitting all those letters and will only agree to submit 10 of them. In that case, you should of course ask for some other professors to fill in the gap, but anyway, you don't want to know about this a week before the application deadline.
* Communicate clearly. It would suck if professors finish your letter but don't know where to submit them. My advice is: (1) It is preferable to send official requests through application portals in batches so those emails don't get lost in the professor's email inbox. (2) Create a table in Google Sheet to keep track of the programs you are applying to, the application deadlines, and the status of the requests. For example, knowing the date of when you sent a request will be helpful when a professor looks up that email in their inbox. Of course, share this google sheet with your letter writers. (3) Send email reminders to remind professors about an upcoming application deadline, preferably a week in advance if not more. Note that for most of the programs, the deadline for people to submit letters is some time after the application deadline, so don't panic if a professor only uploads the letters after the deadline.
* Ask for strong letters. It goes without saying that strong letters from professors say a lot about who you are as an applicant -- they will make a difference in your application. So, when you ask for letters, explicitly ask for strong letters, so that professors who will otherwise write average letters can have the chance to let you about that.
