# Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition

## One-line Summary

This work applies backpropagation learning to a large, real-world task: Handwritten digit recognition. The final throughput is ~10 images per second. This is a phenomenal work that precedes many neural network architectures and the MNIST dataset \[99'\] itself.
